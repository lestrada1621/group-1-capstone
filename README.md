# Overview 

Computer Vision wants to break into the movie production industry, but needs insight regarding what types of movies to make. 

We have recommended three courses of action for Computer Vision to follow that will allow their films to be successful at the box office:
* Produce a movie in the animation genre (with the possibility of a comedy sub-genre).
* Allocate $80 million towards movie production. 
* Allocate more marketing effort towards international audiences (rather than domestic audiences). 

We based these recommendations off three high-priority metrics:
* Highest-rated movie genres
* Budget-to-box office ratio
* Which production studios gross the highest
  ** Which genres of movies these production studios produce

After identifying **animation** as the genre Computer Vision should pursue, we wanted to explore the difference between the genre's foreign and domestic gross. Specifically, we hypothesize that the animation genre will gross higher internationally than domestically. Based on the results of the test we can determine where to best spend marketing efforts to maximize profitability.

The results of our statistical test show that with 95% confidence foreign gross is significantly greater than domestic gross in the Animation genre. This indicates that more money should be spent marketing to foreign markets as opposed to domestic.
