After identifying **Animation** as the genre Computer Vision should pursue, we wanted to explore the difference between the genre's foreign and domestic gross. Specifically, we hypothesize that the animation genre will gross higher internationally than domestically. Based on the results of the test we can determine where to best spend marketing efforts to maximize profitability.

The results of our statistical test show that with 95% confidence foreign gross is significantly greater than domestic gross in the Animation genre. This indicates that more money should be spent marketing to foreign markets as opposed to domestic.
